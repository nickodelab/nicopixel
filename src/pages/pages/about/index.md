### Curious about me?
First of all thank you for your interest in my profile. My name is Nicolás Martín and I'll tell you more about my person (no speech over here about my skills and knowledge. If you are interested on that you can go to my [Linked Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasmartinacosta/), [read my blog posts](https://nicopixel.com/) or [download my CV](./cv_nicopixel.pdf).

### This is HOW I AM (not WHAT I KNOW)

## **THIS IS MY MANIFESTO**

### What are the most important values to me? (Brainstorming is coming)

- Teamwork in the center of my daily work.
- Love **peer programming** as a constantly way of learning and share knowledge.
- I need ambitious and easy to understand **goals** and a strong methodology to work with.
- Searching always for new technologies to implement or **awesome courses** to keep myself always updated.
- Open for remote positions: because remote makes you great developers: **indepent and connected, self-confident and efficient**

### 60% PLANNING / 40% CODING
It's much more important talk and share thoughs about the HOW than go fast to implement an idea in the code. It's extremely important talk and **explain to your collegues** how you want implement something, and this takes me to the next point:

### IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST GO ALONE, IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO WITH A TEAM
I think **the best way to learn is helping others**. Why? try to explain something to others that you don't really deeply understand. Only when you can share the knowledge you really understand something.

### LEADER OVER BOSS
- I prefer the suggestion over the commands. I prefer leaders against bosses (I think everyone wants this, right?)
- I need someone with much knowledge than me, I need someone to learn from in my team

### TO FINISH, THE LAST IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
- **GIT**
- A solid **workflow**: CI development, Git Flow ...
- Don't without **Testing**
- Using the power of **Pull Requests** to share my code
- Long life for **Agile**
