### Curious about me?
First of all thank you for your interesting in my profile. My name is Nicolás Martín and I'll tell you more about my person (no speech over here about my skills and knowledge. If you are interested on that go to my [Linked Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasmartinacosta/), [read my blog posts](https://nicopixel.com/) or [download my CV](./test.pdf).

This is HOW I AM and not WHAT I KNOW.

**THIS IS MY MANIFESTO**

1. Remote and teamwork are allies not enemies. Being far away doesn't means disconnection, quite the opposite: remote work requires link people in a continuous, constantly and focussed way.

2. Remote work requires evaluates employees based on goals and no in time invested. So, you'll need first define and develop a SMART goals

3. Invest the time you need to create a solid base before go to the next layer, otherwise you'll come back to re-build the code

4. Testing first, testing after and testing again. I love and I believe in testing as a driver of a solid code

5. Don't without a solid WORKFLOW. Yep, of course use Trello or Jira is important but without a methodology they are useless. Interested in CI Development, Agile, Git Flow... 

6. Much better a leader (suggest) than a boss (command)

7. Only one word to describe this point: GIT

8. Continuos formation as personal and professional development? Ohhhh Yes!

9. Salary? yes, another important point that HAVE to be in the list

10. Motivation? most of the previuos points are in your life? then motivation appears as if by magic
