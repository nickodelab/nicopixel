### Curious about me?
First of all thank you for your interesting in my profile. My name is NicolÃ¡s MartÃ­n and I'll tell you more about my person (no speech over here about my skills and knowledge. If you are interested on that you can go to my [Linked Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasmartinacosta/), [read my blog posts](https://nicopixel.com/) or [download my CV](./cv_nicopixel.pdf).

###Â This is HOW I AM (not WHAT I KNOW)

## **THIS IS MY MANIFESTO**

### WORK + LIFE. How? 
I strongly believe in the Remote WORK, this is how I want to LIVE. So, henceforth I'll refer to RemoteWork as a RemoteLife or just simply Remote. **Remote is a life style**.

To deny some concepts that I have heard or felt or just to keep in mind, here some important points:

- RemoteLife and TeamWork are allies not enemies.
- Being far away doesn't means disconnection, quite the opposite: RemoteLife forces you to **link people** in a continuous, constantly and focussed way.
- RemoteLife forces you to evaluate your collegues ** based on goals ** and not in time invested
- RemoteLife helps **personal development**
- RemoteLife makes a better developer: **more indepent but more connected, stronger, willing to help, self-confident and more efficient**
- RemoteLife makes me happier thus more productive: RemoteLife it's a great freedom but also a big responsability

**If you are a company and you don't have Remotelife mindset, please don't contact me**

### 60% PLANNING / 40% CODING
It's much more important talk and share thoughs about the HOW than go fast to implement an idea in the code. It's extremely important talk and **explain to you collegues** how you want implement something, and this takes me to the next point:

### IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST GO ALONE, IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO WITH A TEAM
The team is really near to you in a RemoteLife. And this is not only happy and beautiful words. I think **the best way to learn is helping others**. Why? try to explain something to others that you don't really deeply understand. Only when you can share the knowledge you really understand something.

###Â LEADER OVER BOSS
- I prefer the suggestion over the commands. I prefer leaders against bosses (I think everyone wants this, right?)
- I need someone with much knowledge than me, I need someone to learn from in my team

### TO FINISH, THE LAST BUT IMPORTANT
- GIT
- A solid workflow: CI development, Git Flow ...
- Extraction request (Yes, I have to put this because there are some computers that are doing remote control without extraction request) ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜° ðŸ¤¯
- Honest salary
- Support to finish my career (Computer Engineering)
